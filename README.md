# 22-Projects
I have completed 22 foundational projects, focusing on core web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These projects were designed to solidify my understanding of essential programming concepts, while also sharpening my problem-solving and coding skills. Each project helped me reinforce best practices in front-end development, laying a strong groundwork for more advanced work. Thank you!
